I've never eaten a morel mushroom! and despite trekking through the woods all the time, I haven't spotted any in a long while. So, I've decided to cultivate some of my own so that I can try them. With all of my projects, I like to document the process; you know, draw pictures, do some research, keep a project journal, write some code. Like my carnivorous plant [terrarium notebooks and code](https://github.com/digitalvapor/terrarium), this [Open Source Morels](https://github.com/digitalvapor/open-source-morels) project is simply my log of cultivating morel mushrooms. The two [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella#Species) I am starting with are *Morchella Esculenta*, (Common or [Yellow Morel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_esculenta)) and *Morchella Elata* ([Black Morel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_elata)). I noticed that online there are only a few species available, but that there are more than 60 species of *Morchella* worldwide! [^1] The second part of the project, if there is public interest, would be to create a public spore library for these delicious morels! Everyone would be able to share in cultivating and enjoying these yummy fungi.

With this being the first day of research, I believe that the first documented case of cultivation was by Dr. Ch. Repin, an *attaché à l'Institut Pasteur*, who in 1901 obtained fruiting bodies in a cave. The cultures had been established in 1892 in flower pots. [^2] The first lab cultivation I believe is by Ronald Ower, Gary Mills, and James Malachowski at San Francisco State University in 1982. [^3] They successfully created a full life cycle of the *Morchella esculenta*, from [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha) to [sclerotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotium) and [conidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conidium), to ascocarp and then ascospore discharge. The time from the first [ascocarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascocarp) detection to [ascospore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascospore) discharge was four weeks, from December 14, 1980 till January 11, 1981.

Gary Mills talks about this in the Scientific American Frontiers episode *About All You Can Eat*. [^4] Chedd Angier introduces the first lab cultivated morels by Gary Mill's team at about `37:25`.

If you are looking for some starter literature on morel cultivation, check out the Resources for Mushroom Growers [Morel Mushroom Cultivation](http://mushroomcompany.com/resources/morels/index.shtml) from The Mushroom Grower's Newsletter. A couple great resources for identifying any mushrooms are [inaturalist.org](http://inaturalist.org) and [mushroomobserver.org](http://mushroomobserver.org). Until I release the first pages, if you are hungry and excited about mycology (or just hungry), try Fonda's [shrimp, tofu, and wood ear mushroom potsticker recipe](potstickers.html). Very delicious.
