I've never eaten a morel mushroom! and despite trekking through the woods all the time, I haven't spotted any in a long while. So, I've decided to cultivate some of my own so that I can try them. With all of my projects, I like to document the process; you know, draw pictures, do some research, keep a project journal, write some code. Like my carnivorous plant `terrarium notebooks and code <https://github.com/digitalvapor/terrarium>`_, this `Open Source Morels <https://github.com/digitalvapor/open-source-morels>`_ project is simply my log of cultivating morel mushrooms. The two `species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella#Species>`_ I am starting with are *Morchella Esculenta*, (Common or `Yellow Morel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_esculenta>`_) and *Morchella Elata* (`Black Morel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella_elata>`_). I noticed that online there are only a few species available, but that there are more than 60 species of *Morchella* worldwide! [#]_ The second part of the project, if there is public interest, would be to create a public spore library for these delicious morels! Everyone would be able to share in cultivating and enjoying these yummy fungi.

With this being the first day of research, I believe that the first documented case of cultivation was by Dr. Ch. Repin, an *attaché à l'Institut Pasteur*, who in 1901 obtained fruiting bodies in a cave. The cultures had been established in 1892 in flower pots. [#]_ The first lab cultivation I believe is by Ronald Ower, Gary Mills, and James Malachowski at San Francisco State University in 1982. [#]_ They successfully created a full life cycle of the *Morchella esculenta*, from `hyphae <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha>`_ to `sclerotia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotium>`_ and `conidia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conidium>`_, to ascocarp and then ascospore discharge. The time from the first `ascocarp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascocarp>`_ detection to `ascospore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascospore>`_ discharge was four weeks, from December 14, 1980 till January 11, 1981.

Gary Mills talks about this in the Scientific American Frontiers episode *About All You Can Eat*. [#]_ Chedd Angier introduces the first lab cultivated morels by Gary Mill's team at about ``37:25``.

If you are looking for some starter literature on morel cultivation, check out the Resources for Mushroom Growers `Morel Mushroom Cultivation <http://mushroomcompany.com/resources/morels/index.shtml>`_ from The Mushroom Grower's Newsletter. A couple great resources for identifying any mushrooms are http://inaturalist.org and http://mushroomobserver.org. Until I release the first pages, if you are hungry and excited about mycology (or just hungry), try Fonda's `shrimp, tofu, and wood ear mushroom potsticker recipe <potstickers.html>`_. Very delicious.
