We like space and nature, gadgets and cats, coffee and jasmine lattes. We're bad at skateboarding, but good at drawing skateboarders being eaten by a gigantic arthropod, who weaves vortex cocoons and poops beautiful crystals.

We're currently starting small with the "business" and we take lots of comic book and coffee breaks, sorry. We propogate carnivorous plants, and succulents, and sell terrariums. [<a href='star-bit'>Star-Bit</a>] is great at printmaking and drawing yetis, and [<a href='digitalvapor'>digitalvapor</a>] likes to draw hairy things with lots of dots. [<a href='digitalvapor'>digitalvapor</a>] is also working on some gadgets that will be pretty dope, but they're still in the development phase. Thanks for taking a look!
