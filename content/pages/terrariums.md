Summary: We make awesome terrariums and grow cool plants. We wait an extra month before selling them to make sure the environment is sustainable.

[Contact us](mailto: contact@antivapor.net) if you want a custom terrarium! Our moss and plants are sustainably propagated by us at home. All bones are collected from a friendly owl who pukes them up nearby. Currently we only sell to the San Francisco area, but after we figure out shipping, we'll let you know!
