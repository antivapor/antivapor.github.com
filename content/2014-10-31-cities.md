I really love the night sky, but in San Francisco the night sky is sometimes more observable on the computer if you know what I mean.. you don't? It is REALLY FOGGY ALL THE TIME west of [Sutro Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sutro). Hobby-wise, I've been working on [a PySkyAlmanac fork](https://github.com/digitalvapor/PySkyAlmanac) and have primarily been testing the almanac with my own location. See [the generated San Francisco chart here](https://digitalvapor.github.io/PySkyAlmanac/). I've been making it a wee bit more 'automatic', and now want to test for a smattering of choice cities.

[Brandon Rhodesmill](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/) who wrote [PyEphem](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem) has a [modest database of cities](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/blob/master/ephem/cities.py) that you can use when setting up an astronomical observer. See his quick reference for [settting up an observer](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/quick.html#body-compute-observer).

Here is an example, using my home town of [Winter Springs, FL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Springs,_Florida). Using the coordinates from [geohack](https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Winter_Springs%2C_Florida&params=28_41_36_N_81_16_44_W_region:US_type:city) and elevation (m) from Wikipedia is a breeze, but it is ... more breezy? to just use the database as you can see for San Francisco.

    :::python

    import ephem

    # Winter Springs, FL
    ws = ephem.Observer()
    ws.lon = '28.693333'
    ws.lat = '-81.278889'
    ws.elevation = 16
    ws.date = '2014/10/30 13:20:56'

    # San Francisco, CA
    obs = ephem.city('San Francisco')
    obs.date = '2014/10/30 13:20:56'

These cities are based on some world city criterion. The input is [cities.in](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/blob/master/data/cities.in), to [cities.py](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/blob/master/generate/cities.py) which looks up each city on [fallingrain.com](http://www.fallingrain.com/), and  [rebuild-city-data](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/blob/master/bin/rebuild-city-data) with google maps.

I'm not sure yet where the initial city data came from, but if you search for `global city`, you'll get similar lists.

I have some criterion for testing the sky almanac. I want cities near the 40°N, 50°N, and 30°S latitudes to compare to the [Skygazers Almanac](https://www.shopatsky.com/product/skygazers-almanac-2014-40-deg-n/calendars-and-almanacs) calculated by [Roger W. Sinnott](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/about-us/roger-w-sinnott/). I also wanted some locations near the equator and arctic / antarctic circles.

    :::python

    from ephem import cities
    all_cities = cities._city_data
    num_cities = len(all_cities)
    print('{} cities in PyEphem'.format(num_cities))

    all_lat = []
    all_lon = []
    all_elev = []

    for name in all_cities.keys():
        all_lat.append(float(all_cities[name][0]))
        all_lon.append(float(all_cities[name][1]))
        all_elev.append(float(all_cities[name][2]))

    city_list = zip(all_cities,all_lat,all_lon,all_elev)
    city_list = sorted(city_list,key=lambda x:x[1])
    northernmost = city_list.pop()
    southernmost = city_list[0]
    city_list.remove(southernmost)
    print('northernmost: {} ({}°N)'.format(northernmost[0],northernmost[1]))
    print('southernmost: {} ({}°S)'.format(southernmost[0],southernmost[1]))

    n = [] # northern hemisphere
    s = [] # southern hemisphere

    for city in city_list:
        if(city[1]>=0.0):
            n.append(city)
        else:
            s.append(city)

    nearest_equator_pos = n[0]
    n.remove(nearest_equator_pos)
    nearest_equator_neg = s.pop()
    print('nearest equator in northern hemisphere: {} ({}°N)'.format(nearest_equator_pos[0],nearest_equator_pos[1]))
    print('nearest equator in southern hemisphere: {} ({}°S)'.format(nearest_equator_neg[0],nearest_equator_neg[1]))

    def city_nearest_lat(list_of_cities,latitude):
        sorted_by_closest = sorted(list_of_cities,key=lambda x:(abs(x[1]-latitude)))
        return sorted_by_closest[0]

    neg_30S = city_nearest_lat(s,-30.0)
    print('nearest to 30°S: {} ({}°S)'.format(neg_30S[0],neg_30S[1]))
    neg_40N = city_nearest_lat(n,40.0)
    print('nearest to 40°N: {} ({}°S)'.format(neg_40N[0],neg_40N[1]))
    neg_50N = city_nearest_lat(n,50.0)
    print('nearest to 50°N: {} ({}°S)'.format(neg_50N[0],neg_50N[1]))

    cities_to_test = [northernmost[0],neg_50N[0],neg_40N[0],nearest_equator_pos[0],nearest_equator_neg[0],neg_30S[0],southernmost[0]]
    print('cities to test, from North to South {}'.format(cities_to_test))

Output:

    :::python

    122 cities in PyEphem
    northernmost: Helsinki (60.1698125°N)
    southernmost: Wellington (-41.2924945°S)
    nearest equator in northern hemisphere: Singapore (1.352083°N)
    nearest equator in southern hemisphere: Jakarta (-6.211544°S)
    nearest to 30°S: Brisbane (-27.4709331°S)
    nearest to 40°N: Columbus (39.9611755°S)
    nearest to 50°N: Prague (50.0878114°S)
    cities to test, from North to South ['Helsinki', 'Prague', 'Columbus', 'Singapore', 'Jakarta', 'Brisbane', 'Wellington']

[key](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html?highlight=key#key-functions) is what to sort by after a function is called on each element. [lambda](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) is an anonymous function, so i dont have to define a new function for just returning the second value `x[1]`. same goes for the other use of lambda above in the `city_nearest_lat()` method.

Now, I can set up a different observer at each of my test cities :)

I encourage you to fork the project and [host your city's own](https://github.com/digitalvapor/PySkyAlmanac#fork) almanac.
