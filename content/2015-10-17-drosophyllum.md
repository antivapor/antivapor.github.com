pg2) refreshing my code
pg2) I was just reading <i>On the Care and (Not) Feeding of D. Adelae, Prolifera and Schizandra</i> by Roger Hoelter, and it reminds me of the whole reason I'm working on my [terrarium]() project. He prefaces his discussion with the assumption that everyone's growing conditions are different and "we can never exactly duplicate the growing environment other people use". Although this is mostly true, we can certainly try to get close! One of my original motivators for this project was while I was reading Barry Rice's page on luminosity. His articles are as cheerful as they are informative, and I definitely thought his Barry Units were pretty funny. http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq3400.html So I've included them into this project if you would like to translate your luminosity into Barry Units. The formula is ....

pg1) Update: 2-29
So, when I started writing this post, Peter the Drosophyllum was happy and alive. Unfortunately, he was too advanced and he has passed on. On a happier note though, my Pinguicula is flowering and my Adelae are about to as well! The whole family is super happy.

pg3) I've been planting again.
